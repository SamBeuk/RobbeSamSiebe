# UDP client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a UDP client with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU and AIROC&trade; CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; connectivity devices. The example establishes a connection with a remote UDP server, and based on the command received from the UDP server, turns the user LED ON or OFF.

This example uses the [Wi-Fi middleware core](https://github.com/Infineon/wifi-mw-core) library of the any cloud SDK. This library enables Wi-Fi-based application development by bundling together various other libraries - FreeRTOS, Wi-Fi host driver (WHD), lwIP, and Infineon secure sockets. The Infineon secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP).

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

- Install a Python interpreter if you do not have one. This code example is tested with [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect. These macros are defined in the *udp_client.h* file. Ensure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connecting to is configured as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

3. Ensure your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you have configured in **Step 2**.

4. Determine the computer's IP address.

   To determine the IP address, type the following command in the command shell based on your operating system:

   - Windows: `ipconfig`

   - Linux: `curl ifconfig.me`

   - macOS: `ifconfig |grep inet`


5. Change the `UDP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` macro defined in the *udp_client.h* file to match with the computer's IP address. For example, if your computer's IP address is
   192.168.1.107, update the macro as shown below:

   ```
   #define UDP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS             MAKE_IPV4_ADDRESS(192, 168, 1, 107)
   ```

   **Note:** CYSBSYSKIT-01 reserves UDP and TCP port numbers from `49152` to `57343`.

6. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

7. Ensure that the Python interpreter (see [Software setup](#software-setup) is installed on your computer.

8. Open a command shell from the project directory and run the Python UDP server (*udp_server.py*).  In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

   ```
   python udp_server.py
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the UDP client. For more details on enabling Python access, see this [community thread](https://community.cypress.com/thread/53662).

9. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

10. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the text shown in **Figure 1** is displayed on the UART terminal. Note that Wi-Fi SSID and the IP address assigned will be different based on the network that you have connected to.

    **Figure 1. UART terminal showing the Wi-Fi connectivity status**

    ![](images/uart-terminal-output.png)

11. From the Python UDP server, send the command to turn the LED ON or OFF to the UDP client ('0' to turn the LED OFF and '1' to turn ON). Observe the user LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) turning ON/OFF on the board.

    **Figure 2. UDP server output**

    ![](images/udp-server-output.png)

      <br> 
        
    **Figure 3. LED status on UDP client**

    ![](images/udp-client-output.png)

**Note:** Instead of using the Python UDP server (*udp_server.py*), you can use the example [mtb-example-anycloud-udp-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-anycloud-udp-server) to run as the UDP server on a second kit. See the code example documentation to learn how to use the example. If you are using the example as the server, the IP address (`UDP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`) configured in **Step 5** of the [Operation](#operation) section should be that of the IP address assigned to the kit in the example.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :---------| :-------------    | :------------
 SDIO (HAL) | sdio_obj                | SDIO interface for Wi-Fi connectivity
 UART (HAL) | cy_retarget_io_uart_obj | UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the Debug UART port
 LED (BSP)  | CYBSP_USER_LED          | User LED to show output

This example uses the Arm Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU to execute an RTOS task: UDP Client task. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, PSoC&trade; 6 MCU is configured as a UDP client, which establishes a connection with a remote UDP server, and based on the command received from the UDP Server, turns the user LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) ON or OFF.
